## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Flutter SDK** (v3.0+) - [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **MongoDB Atlas** account (or local MongoDB)
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **VS Code** (recommended) with Flutter & Dart extensions

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file from example
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your MongoDB credentials
# Required environment variables:
# - MONGO_URI: Your MongoDB connection string
# - JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT tokens
# - PORT: Server port (default: 5000)

# Start the backend server
node serve.js
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Admin Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to admin frontend directory
cd frontend/admin/admin_frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The admin panel will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- Email: `admin@german.com`
- Password: `admin@123`

### 3. Flutter Mobile App Setup

```bash
# Navigate to user app directory
cd frontend/user

# Get Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Check connected devices
flutter devices

# Run on Android device/emulator
flutter run -d <device-id>

# Or simply run on the first available device
flutter run
```

**Important Configuration:**
- Update API base URL in Flutter app if needed (currently set to `http://10.96.191.169:5000`)
- The app requires Material Icons - already configured in `pubspec.yaml`

## MongoDB Collections

- `users` - User accounts
- `admins` - Admin accounts
- `foodgroceries` - Food & Grocery listings
- `accommodations` - Rental listings
- `jobs` - Job postings
- `services` - Service providers
- `guides` - Community guides and resources

## Development Tips

### Backend
- Use `node serve.js` to start the server
- API base URL: `http://localhost:5000`
- All admin routes require Bearer token authentication
- CORS is enabled for `http://localhost:3000`

### Admin Frontend
- Built with React and Lucide icons
- Uses localStorage for admin token persistence
- Logout clears the token and redirects to login

### Flutter App
- Uses Material Icons (ensure `uses-material-design: true` in pubspec.yaml)
- User session persists using SharedPreferences
- Bookmarks are saved per user
- Hot reload enabled for fast development

## Deployment

### Backend
1. Set environment variables on your hosting platform
2. Update CORS origins in `serve.js` to include your frontend domain
3. Deploy to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean

### Admin Frontend
1. Build production version: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `build` folder to hosting platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3

### Flutter App
1. Build for Android: `flutter build apk`
2. Build for iOS: `flutter build ios`
3. Submit to Google Play Store / Apple App Store

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- **Port already in use**: Change PORT in .env or kill the process using that port
- **MongoDB connection failed**: Check MONGO_URI in .env
- **Unauthorized errors**: Verify JWT_SECRET matches across all requests

### Flutter Issues
- **Icons showing as boxes**: Ensure `uses-material-design: true` in pubspec.yaml
- **API connection failed**: Update IP address in API base URL
- **Build errors**: Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`

### Admin Frontend Issues
- **API errors**: Ensure backend is running on port 5000
- **Login issues**: Check browser console for errors and verify credentials

## Support

For issues or questions, please contact the development team.

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
